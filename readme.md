# Assessment Questions


## Question 1
Provide an overview and description of a standard source control process for a large project.

### Answer
Source control (or version control) is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code. The codebase is usually stored in a SCM (Source Control Management) system which will help to track and manage code that is uploaded/pushed from multiple sources/developers. The SCM system will help to track code changes, historical changes/revision, different versions of the codebase at different points in the development process and enable collaboration between multiple developers – each with their own versions of the codebase which can later be merged together after detectable conflicts are resolved.


## Question 2

## Question 3
Outline a standard high-level structure for a MERN stack application and explain the components.

### Answer
A MERN stack application is comprised of four main technologies – Mongo, Express, React and Node. 

MongoDB
Mongo is a document-orientated “NoSQL” database program. It is used to store information in documents (in JSON format) – as opposed to a traditional SQL database which uses relational tables.

Node & Express
Node is a JavaScript environment with libraries that make it easier to write software. Express extends Node specifically to make it easier to create webservers. Therefore, Express is a server-side framework which is used for building web/mobile applications and API’s.

React
React is a JavaScript library/framework for building client-side user interfaces. This is the part of the application that is rendered in the user web browser and is how the user interacts with the application.

As stated, the user (client) interacts with the application via the user interface which is rendered to the users screen via the React framework. When the user/client triggers certain events, React will send or request data to/from the applications Server/Backend (Node/Express) API/s which are listening for incoming requests. The Server will then send a response/s back to the client – perhaps querying and saving data to the Mongo database first.


## Question 4
A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?
